# Dealership-Practice-Project

This is a continuation in my Java refresh practice. Taking a look at the code, you will see that this is just a simple outline for how to work with classes in Java, and some other simple implementations of object oriented programming practices. This was a good way to get back into things after working with JavaScript for so long.

There isn't much to explain in how it works, but eventually I want to throw in functionality that will allow one to input their own info via the console.
